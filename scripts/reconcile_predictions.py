"""Reports the model's real track record: every prediction reconciled against
its actual result, via the always-live `prediction_results` view (predictions
JOIN stats.games, computed fresh -- no separate table to keep in sync).

Also flags when enough new completed 2026 games have accumulated to be worth
folding into a retrain: the trained model only knows 2016-2024 (holdout 2025,
see scripts/train_model.py) -- results piling up here are exactly the new
season's data a retrain would add.
