"""Opponent-adjusted team ratings via iterative SRS (Simple Rating System:
rating = average scoring margin + average opponent rating, solved iteratively
to convergence). Ported from the CFB build as-is -- the algorithm is sport-
agnostic. Less load-bearing here than in CFB (a 17-game, formula-balanced
32-team league has far less schedule-strength variance than 130+ FBS teams with
wildly uneven schedules and a two-tier FBS/FCS structure), but still cheap
signal worth keeping, and it feeds the EPA-rolling-form module's own
opponent-strength control (src/epa_features.py).

Computed strictly chronologically (per season, using only games from weeks
already completed) so no game's rating ever reflects a game that hasn't been
played yet -- the same no-leakage discipline as the ELO module. Caller passes
whatever team identifier it wants tracked; build_features.py passes
franchise_id(team) so a rating carries across a relocation (STL->LA, SD->LAC,
OAK->LV), matching src/elo.py's convention.
